## Introduction 
This was a project I developed in a team of 4 while I was on a remote internship at Accenture.

The theme for this project was to develop a Website with the theme of Sustainability.
The project was aimed as an introduction to collaborative work on Code and was part of the assessment process for a job offer. 

Following the completion of the project and a final interview, I was offered a job at Accenture. 


## Learning Points
The work I completed was a lot of foundational work, this included the Wireframes, HTML skeleton and a lot of foundational CSS. 

I wanted to focus a lot more on JavaScript with this project as this was the area I was most unfamiliar with, 
I worked on the interactive banner as well as the interactive map page, that allows users to search for store details. 

I wish I could have worked more on the JavaScript part of the project. However, I ended up working on a lot of the foundational code instead. 

Another key learning point for me was the group work aspect. The people on the internship had a variety of backgrounds and experiences.
Therefore it was important to look at individuals' skill levels and ensure they were assigned appropriate work. 
I had a more leadership-heavy role in this project so I also spent a lot of my development time allocating and explaining work. 
I also felt a responsibility in ensuring the work assigned to people was within their skill level and not overwhelming. 

If I was to complete this project again I would focus more on UI. There were a lot of areas were UI could have been improved and I have since developed UI skills from completing my dissertation.
