        <p>We currently have eight recycling and parts centre around England. If you have a small amount of
            technology that needs recycling feel free to drop into any of our centers. We take most electronic products, 
            but we specialise in mobile phones, laptops and desktops. All Hard Drives are wiped and destroyed on site to
            remove the risk of sensitve data being stolen. In cases of large items and a large collection we will pick up 
            items. However this depends on distance and value so please get in touch with us for more information.
